## Overview

In this game, the player must uncover the secret treasures hidden within the walls of the mine. However, you must 
be careful as doing too much can cause the wall to collapse causing you to lose all your treasure.

This game was made using Python and PyGame.

## Gamemodes

There are two game modes: regular and endless. Regular is just one round of the game while endless features endless amounts of 
mining walls to see what your highest score is.

## Gameplay

In both modes, the player must find all 4 treasures hidden in the wall using the hammer and chisel. The hammer breaks more tiles but deals severe damage to the wall while the chisel breaks only a single tile but deals a little amount of damage to the wall. If the wall's damage bar fills up all the way to the top, the mine will collapse and that is the end of the run. 


## Future Additions
- Add a setting to switch the amount of treasures in the level
- Add a setting to allow different grid sizes
- Add a potential level system
- Add a way to compete with friends in real-time (joint lobbies)
